        <h2>Why I am in the Information Systems Program?</h2>
        <p>
            With three years of work experience as a Data Engineer in India, I developed a strong technical foundation in data migration, cloud technologies, and data warehousing. However, I realized that to truly excel in my career, I needed to understand the business side of the projects I was working on. Pursuing a master's in Information Systems allows me to bridge the gap between technical expertise and business acumen, positioning myself to take on more strategic roles in the future.
